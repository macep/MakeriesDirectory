Long chats with elderly gents and trial and error cracked it! We use pure Mimosa extract from plantation grown trees in South Africa grown specifically for the purpose and no part of the tree is wasted. Only tannin from vegetable origin is environmentally friendly, nothing else is biodegradable. Mimosa gives a warm, soft, machine washable skin, with the fleece, fibre or hair as nature intended, minus the dirt and debris, which is friendly to people, babies and other animals.We have our own reed bed which cleans our grey water and supports its own eco system.\"\r\n\r\nOrganic Notes: Organic Sheepskins is the only organically certified tannery in the UK.

We specialize in vintage hat making goods, and modern supplies with vintage flair.\r\n\r\nHello, I am Michelle, owner of Petershams Millinery. I'm a California girl who moved to London, England almost ten years ago. What a change of landscape! For the first time ever I found myself purchasing winter coats, mittens, umbrellas and...hats!\r\n\r\nBut it was not always the functional hats that took my interest. It was the amazing hats ladies wore to the races, the fancy little numbers that adorned guests at a wedding. And the bride? Always my favourite! I simply needed to know how to make these masterpieces. After years of training in London I built up a great collection of vintage supplies and I am over the moon to be sharing it with you.",

I feel privileged to be able to work on great source materials, and incredibly proud of the chairs I make.\r\nThe furniture I re-create is built (literally) on a foundation of quality craftsmanship that you just don't see in new furniture.

It accepts both medium format and 35mm film. Each and every VIDDY is screenprinted and die-cut by hand in the UK and is available in 4 colours; Green, Black, Blue or Red.",

This leads me in my practice to respond to objects, found imagery and aesthetic stimuli. There is a humour and playfulness in my work that comes unbidden.\r\n\r\nPrimarily I am a collage artist who works purely in paper and only using images that I can find, i.e. I will not use digital images, it must come from a book, magazine or journal etc. This discipline merges into drawing, diorama, shadow boxes and also sculpture.",

I've pretty much given up my own art for my obsession with the banjo.

One of my client is Roksanda Ilincic, I advise her team and make their belts and other decorative products for Roksanda's shop. Moreover, with time and experience I have now a serious contact book regarding all sorts of suppliers.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to design a piece, I would be able to advice you on the design and style. And regarding the making, I could help with technical solutions and advice on materials (type, thickness, prices.. ). I also make models and/or full productions, depending on the project.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me for any information!\r\n\r\nAll the best, Marina",

    "longDescription": "Our story began in Manchester in 1886 with a man called Fred. Fred had two things a bright idea and a cracking beard.\r\n\r\nWe've grown a fair bit over the last 128 years but we still do what Fred did all those years ago - supply materials to people who make things. We started off with just three products selling to the cotton traders and master brewers of Manchester. Now we stock more than 25,000 products and sell to customers all over the world.\r\n\r\nInspiring new ideas and encouraging people are values that Fred the First instilled in the company when we began. We've flourished thanks to these simple ideals and were pretty sure thats why were still a family run business after all these years. We just love those people who have that urge to pick up a pencil, brush or needle and want to create. If you're one of these people we salute you.",

    "longDescription": "Etched is a creative laser studio working with clients and our own brand, to visualise concepts and products through innovative digital crafting. We are nestled in the glorious hills of the Rossendale Valley in Lancashire where inspiration is never far away. Close proximity to many design studios means that we have collaborated with,and produced work for, some fabulous local designers as well as creating projects that are destined for different areas of the country. Consequently we offer a very personal bespoke service that reflects exceptional attention to detail. Each project is treated with the greatest of care to ensure that the highest quality is achieved. Whether we are crafting wedding stationery or corporate pieces, we want people to be excited as we are when they receive their piece of Etched work. Whilst the Etched ethos is to produce the most intricate, unique product that captures the vision of client, emphasis is on bespoke crafting that reflects the value of design and beauty of craft.\r\n\r\nEtched is owned by Claire Williams who has a personal interest in the collaborative link between digital technology and creative arts, consequently exploring the potential of drawing and printing through the use of unorthodox materials such as laser cutting in an educational and business sense. With a background training in surface print design, a basis for the understanding and creation of products across creative disciplines is reflected in our diverse clients and our variety of outcomes.\r\n\r\nImage: work of Amy Swann",

Animaux Circus can be found working in their studio in London, or out and about in the wilderness, leaving their designs across the world and populating it with their eccentric creatures and bold typography.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that every project is created to the highest possible standard, great care and attention to detail is given to every job we have the pleasure of working on, big or small. Do get in touch, we'd love to hear from you.",

    "briefDescription": "will turn your illustrations into beautiful repeating patterns",
    "longDescription": "I am a Surface Pattern Designer, I make repeat patterns out of images etc. I design my own repeat patterns but I can also be commissioned to design repeat patterns for you the customer. You can give me your raw designs, even a sheet of paper or a JPEG image and I can help you make this into a repeat pattern. I use Illustrator mainly because you can easily scale the designs without loosing quality and I can use Photoshop. I am really interested in layout and different methods of repeating designs, be it half drop, brick repeat, tossed etc and there are many more. I am here to help you and no job is too small to do, I am open to any ideas you may have.\r\n\r\nI have always worked in an Artistic environment and I have had a great deal of business experience mainly to do with 'on-line' business. I created a company called Crafty Computer Paper in 2003 which is still here today and trading with a company called Specialist Crafts who I sold it to in 2010.\r\n\r\nIf you are not sure about digital art of pattern repeats, I can help to explain all the processes involved. I would very much like to think that I would be an asset to your project and give you excellent quality service and work.",

In his own words:\r\n\"Being introduced to woodwork by my engineering father, having a lathe and a workshop from an early age and spending many hours dreaming of selling my craft, all contributed to my woodworking adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter years of being a Chef working in various prestigious hotels, gaining many competitive accolades has taught me the art of presentation and showmanship. My work at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden and qualifications gained have all helped to fuel my passion and develop my creative mind set, and a complete move to south Wales, and setting up a small joinery business from scratch led to various types of work.\r\n\r\nI can take on all forms of bespoke joinery, including: Newport Foley featured on Grand Designs, exhibition contracts for original Dr Who exhibition, Cardiff, Robin Hood Up Close, Nottingham and Postman Pat Village, Longleat.\r\n\r\nThese experiences helped my decision to pursue the dream to produce smaller, more creative and functional pieces, working with simple shapes and curves using the timber's natural elements help to bring a tactile functionaland creative product that enhances any environment.",

The process is useful for printing heavier and textured fabrics and can also provide a vehicle for up-cycling products, personalisation and as an alternative to embroidered decoration, thus expanding the potential of digital print for luxury fashion and interior applications.\r\n\r\nThe company offers printing with no minimum runs, from sampling to full production runs and can provide print design services and post-print sewn finishes, such as scarf hemming, labelling and cushion cover making.\r\n\r\nSustainability is a key theme, with the use of inks and processing compliant with the ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals) Manufacturing Restricted Substances List.",
